🌟 Hi, I'm Prabhat Prajapati — a passionate Java & Full Stack Developer 🚀  

💻 I have built this portfolio using **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**, focusing on 
modern design, performance, and responsiveness.  

🔑 My expertise lies in building **secure, scalable, and production-ready 
applications** using Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, MySQL, and React.  

✅ I have completed my internship at **HulkHire Tech**, where I learned industry-level 
development practices, team collaboration, and advanced integration techniques.  

⚡ Some of my key projects include:  
- 🔒 **Authentication Service** – Role-based authentication, authorization, hashing, global exception handling, JDBC-MySQL.  
- 📂 **Project Management Service** – Secure project storage & frontend showcase, with user project upload & feedback features.  
- 🌍 **Travel & Tourism Management System** – A Java desktop app for bookings with secure login and intuitive dashboard.  

📌 I actively update my GitHub with new features and improvements, reflecting my 
continuous learning journey. Until I secure a role in the industry, I will keep 
building **real-world projects**, learning new technologies, and polishing my skills.  

🎯 My goal is simple: **to deliver value, write clean and scalable code, and grow 
as a developer while contributing to impactful projects.**
